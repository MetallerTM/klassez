# **KLASSEZ**

The *klassez* package is a collection of classes and functions to handle NMR data.

It is organized in modules, each of which contains functions dedicated to specific tasks.

Full documentation is available, after installation of the package, through the function **open_doc**, which displays the file *klassez.pdf* located in the "docs" subfolder of your install dir.

Some of the functions employed by *klassez* are taken from the NMRGLUE package and modified to suit the needs of the *klassez* package itself.

---

*klassez* is developed and tested on *Ubuntu 22.04 LTS*. Other OS should encounter no issues; however, if it raises any errors, please notify.
