The **KLASSEZ** package is a collection of classes and functions to handle NMR data.
It is organized in modules, each of which contains functions dedicated to specific tasks.
Some of the functions employed by KLASSEZ are taken from the `NMRGLUE package`_ and modified to suit the needs of the KLASSEZ package itself.
KLASSEZ is developed and tested on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS. Other OS should encounter no issues; however, if it raises any errors, please notify.
