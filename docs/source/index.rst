The **KLASSEZ** package is a collection of classes and functions to handle NMR data.
It is organized in modules, each of which contains functions dedicated to specific tasks.
Some of the functions employed by **KLASSEZ** are taken from the `nmrglue package`_ and modified to suit the needs of the **KLASSEZ** package itself.
**KLASSEZ** is developed and tested on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS. Other OS should encounter no issues; however, if it raises any errors, please notify.
